# LinkedList

I made a linked list Java class that supports integer linked lists. Currently, it has the following methods:

	LinkedList()	: Constructor for a linked list object
	getTotalNodes()	: Accessor that shows the total number of nodes in the list
	add()			: Adds an element to the end of the list
	print()			: Prints the list contents to console in order
	pop_off()		: Takes the last value off of the list and returns it. After the method is called, said node will no longer be on the list
